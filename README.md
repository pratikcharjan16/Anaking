# Anaking — PROJECT BEACON research platform

A Flask survey platform for pharma market research: multi-study builder, gamified
respondent survey with audio narration and a conjoint (discrete-choice) experiment,
live admin dashboard, data-quality flags and Excel/CSV/JSON exports.

The original deliverable — a 24-question conjoint survey for a fictional oncology brand
launch (PROJECT BEACON, US oncologists) — ships pre-seeded as study `beacon`.

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py --port 8000                           # add --debug for auto-reload
```

Three separate apps, each on its own URL (the home page at `/` links to all of them):

| App | URL | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Home** | `/` | Landing page: links to the three apps + list of studies on the server |
| **Survey** | `/survey/` | Respondent link — the live BEACON survey. Respondents never see which section a question belongs to (screeners / main are team-only), and while a question is on screen the project bar, HUD and progress strip are hidden — they belong to the welcome and closing screens |
| | `/survey/test` | Same survey, stored as **test data** (codes T001, T002 …) |
| | `/survey/<slug>` , `/survey/<slug>/test` | Any study launched from the Studio (test mode also previews drafts) |
| **Studio** | `/studio/` (`/studio/#<slug>` opens a study) | Builder — create / edit / launch studies, design the walkthrough, generate conjoint designs, per-study analysis |
| **Admin** | `/admin/` (`?study=<slug>` picks a study) | Dashboard — live counts, quota fill, QC flags, written-answer AI review, downloads, reset |
| | `/admin/export.xlsx\|csv\|json?study=…&scope=all\|real\|test` | Exports |
| | `/healthz` | Liveness check |

Old respondent links (`/test`, `/s/<slug>`) redirect permanently to the new `/survey/…` paths.

Every page header carries the same **Home · Survey · Studio · Admin** switcher, so the team can hop
between apps without retyping anything. Respondents see none of this — the team strip on the survey
only renders in test mode (`/survey/<slug>/test`), which is also where drafts are previewed; the
respondent link of a draft or closed study shows a "not launched yet" page instead.

**Access.** There is no sign-in, token or password: Studio, Admin, the APIs and the exports are
open to anyone who can reach the server. Restrict access at the network or reverse-proxy layer
(VPN, IP allow-list, HTTP basic auth in nginx/Caddy, …) before exposing the platform publicly.

Configuration (environment variables): `PORT`, `HOST`, `DB_PATH`, `VOICE_DIR`, `NARRATION_DIR`,
`MEDIA_DIR`, `SECRET_KEY`. Defaults put the database in `data/survey.db`, respondent recordings in
`uploads/voice/` and uploaded narration in `uploads/narration/<study>/`.

### Studio workspace (Studio → Questions)

The builder is a three-pane workspace - nothing to open or apply, and **every change autosaves**
about a second after you stop typing (toggle in the top bar; `Ctrl/⌘+S` or **Save now** forces it;
the bar always shows *All changes saved · 14:02* / *Unsaved changes* / *Not saved - Retry*).

| Pane | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Outline** (left) | Sections with their questions. Click a row to edit it; hover for move / duplicate / delete (delete offers **Undo**). **+ Add question** opens a picker of plain-English types ("Choose one", "Rating grid", "Open text"…) grouped by kind; the new question lands after the selected one and gets the next free id. Section titles are edited in place. |
| **Editor** (middle) | One scrolling form for the selected question, with a jump bar: **Question** (rich text + help), **Answer options / Rows & scale** (one row per entry: position number, drag grip, code, label, ➔ Pipe in answer, image, an always-visible tool strip — move up, move down, delete — and a one-click *None of these* / *Not applicable* / *Other*, *Enter multiple…*; Pin / Exclusive / Other behaviour chips sit on their own line under the label. Sequence changes three ways: **drag the grip**, the **▲ / ▼** buttons, or focus a grip and press **↑ / ↓**), **Display & order** (layout segment, randomise, hide number / codes, font / size / alignment), **Show only when…** (conditions in sentence form - *when Q1 has selected Oncology*, and/or, invert), **Image or video**, **Advanced (JSON)**. Id, type (convertible - compatible answers are kept), section and Required sit in the header. |
| **Live preview** (right) | The question rendered by the same code respondents run; updates as you type. Sample answers for piping / logic, reshuffle, desktop / phone width, ▶ **Test** opens it full size. |

Rich text: bold / italic / underline / strike / superscript, text & highlight colour, lists,
bigger / smaller, clear formatting. **Piping:** every text field has a **➔ Pipe in answer**
button - click where the answer should appear, press it, pick from a searchable list grouped by
earlier question ("Their answer (as text)", "Answer code", "First / last option they ticked",
"Text typed in Other", a fixed option label, a row's rating, the question wording), each with an
*e.g.* from the sample answers. Tokens show as chips in the editor and are stored as plain text
(`{Q3}`, `{Q3.code}`, `{Q3.opt:2}`, `{Q3.first}`/`{Q3.last}`, `{Q3.other}`, `{Q3.row:a}`,
`{Q3.r:a}`, `{Q3.stem}`); an unanswered reference renders as "…".

The dashboard (Studio home) lists studies as cards with completion stats, search and a
draft / live / closed filter; status is switched from the segment in the builder bar
(launching asks for confirmation and flushes any pending save first).

Rich text is whitelisted on save (`core/sanitize.py`) and again in the browser
(`static/js/qlogic.js`), so only formatting survives — no scripts, event handlers or unsafe URLs.
The plain-text `stem` is kept in step with the rich `stem_html` for exports, narration and QC.
`static/css/preview-skin.css` is generated from `survey.css` by
`python3 scripts/build_preview_skin.py` (re-run after changing survey styles).

### Survey options & globalisation (Studio bar → SURVEY OPTIONS)

The builder bar carries the full **SURVEY OPTIONS** menu: **Settings**, **Share survey
preview** (test + respondent links, copy button), **Move survey…** (new slug - uploaded
media and narration travel with it), **Duplicate**, **Download Word Outline** (a real
`.docx` of the questionnaire, in any language, written with the standard library only),
**Start Tracking** (go live), **Duplicate & Translate…** (copy the study and jump straight
into its translation panel), **Globalize Survey…**, **Edit title and language…** and
**Delete survey**.

**Globalisation.** A study is authored in its default language (**English US** unless
changed in *Edit title and language*) and can be translated into any of the ~36 approved
field languages (`core/i18n.py`). Only **respondent-visible** strings are extractable -
question stems and rich text, help text, placeholders, option / row / column labels,
scale labels, section titles, the welcome & thank-you pages, walkthrough scene captions -
so notes and directions aimed at the research team are *never* offered for translation
and always stay in the default language. The **Globalize Survey** panel lists each
language with its coverage bar and offers, per language:

* **manual translation** - a searchable table (context · source · translation, *missing
  only* filter) that saves through `POST /api/studio/translate`;
* **AI-translate missing** - server-side machine translation
  (`core/translator.py`, keyless Google endpoint, tag-safe for rich text) that fills only
  the gaps and never overwrites manual work; when the network is unavailable every string
  is reported as failed and simply stays for manual translation.

Respondents pick their language on the welcome page (native names); the choice re-renders
the survey (`/api/spec/<slug>?lang=es`), RTL languages flip the page direction, missing
strings fall back to the default language, and each respondent's language is stored and
exported as a `language` column.

**Survey flow & objects** (also in the add-item library): Welcome Page / Thank You Page
(copy lives in Settings → *Survey pages & flow*), **Question Page** (new section),
**Question Loop** (ask one text/number question for a list of items), **Page Randomizer**
(middle sections shuffle per respondent, seeded by their session) and **Embedded
Variables** (names captured from the respondent link, e.g. `?panel=A` → exported as
`ev_panel`).

### The add-item library (Studio → + Add question)

Grouped exactly like a commercial builder: **Questions** - Multiple Choice (incl. image
options), Grid / Rating Scale, Rank Order, Scale, Text Entry, Numeric Entry, Net Promoter,
Constant Sum, Numeric Matrix, Date, Delta (before / after / change); **Methodologies** -
Max Diff experiment, Conjoint, Concept Test, Heatmap; **Survey flow** - Welcome Page,
Thank You Page, Question Page, Question Loop, Page Randomizer; **Objects** - Embedded
Variable, Text Block. Every type is fully editable (rows, scales, ranges, labels,
placeholders, rich text, logic, media, styling) and every answer type flows into the
flattened exports and the data dictionary.

### Written-answer quality: AI-generated & pasted text (all open-text questions)

Free text is the part of a study most often faked - paste a chatbot answer into the box and
move on - so **every** free-text answer the study can collect is checked: each `open_text`
question *and* every "please specify" box. The check is plain Python (`core/ai_detect.py`):
no model weights, no network call, no new dependency, and it never deletes or blocks data.

Two families of evidence are combined into one 0-100 score:

| Family | Signals |
|---|---|
| **Linguistic** | AI self-identification and refusal phrasing ("as an AI language model…"), hallmark vocabulary (*delve, moreover, it is important to note, robust, landscape, streamline*…), markdown / smart-quote artefacts and list-shaped answers, a metronome sentence rhythm, essay-shaped paragraphs, an impersonal register with no contractions, *firstly / secondly / finally* scaffolding, no numbers or specifics from real practice |
| **Behavioural** | keystrokes, pasted characters, characters per second of active typing, one-shot paste bursts, long tab-switches while "writing" — collected by `static/js/survey.js` and stored with the answer as `_meta` |

Human evidence subtracts (contractions, first person, informal phrasing, concrete numbers,
mechanical slips), so a rough, first-hand answer cannot be pushed over the line by one stray
"overall,". Typing also pushes the pasted-character count back down, so a respondent who pastes
a draft and then rewrites it by hand is not still carrying that paste on their record.

The same scoring runs three times over the same answer, which is what makes the flag defensible:

1. **While the respondent types** — `POST /api/check_text` scores the text as they go. The box
   shows a chip with the score and the reasons ("AI-typical vocabulary · no contractions"),
   plus proofreading notes (doubled words, placeholder brackets, run-on sentences, stray
   markdown). In **confirm** mode they must either rewrite it or press *"I wrote this myself"*
   before moving on; **warn** mode never holds them up.
2. **On submit** — a final proofreading step lists every written answer that still looks
   AI-generated, pasted or broken, with a rewrite box and a re-check button, before the survey
   is sent. `POST /api/submit` re-scores everything server-side, so a client that skipped the
   live call is still flagged: `ai_generated_<qid>` (likely), `ai_suspect_<qid>` (possible) and
   the respondent-level roll-up `ai_generated_verbatim`.
3. **After the field closes** — Admin → **Written answers** is the review queue: roll-up counts,
   per-question breakdown, and every answer worst-first with its score, evidence, proofreading
   notes, paste / keystroke telemetry and cross-respondent duplicates (one AI answer shared
   round a panel). Filter by question, verdict or text; the same data ships as the
   **Verbatim AI check** sheet of the Excel export, and per-answer columns
   (`<qid>_ai_score`, `<qid>_ai_verdict`, `<qid>_ai_confirmed_own_words`, `<qid>_pasted_chars`,
   `<qid>_keystrokes`) in **Responses**.

Flags raised: `ai_generated_<qid>` (likely) and `ai_suspect_<qid>` (possible), plus a
respondent-level `ai_generated_verbatim`. Nothing is ever deleted or blocked after the fact - a
flagged answer stays in the data, marked, so the team can decide what to do with it.

Settings live in Studio → **Settings & quality control** ("Written-answer AI check": what the
respondent sees, warn-from / flag-from thresholds, and whether every open-text answer or only
the listed verbatim ids are checked) with a per-question override on each open-text question
(`ai_check`, `ai_action`). The check is **on by default** for every study, including ones saved
before it existed.

### Product walkthrough (Studio → "Walkthrough" tab)

The animated walkthrough respondents see before the survey is an editable list of **scenes**.
Each scene has a title, caption, an artwork picked from the built-in set (patient, trial,
mechanism, efficacy, safety, biomarker, dosing, access, attributes, generic) and — optionally —
an uploaded narration clip (mp3 / m4a / ogg / wav / webm, ≤ 8 MB). Scenes can be added, removed
and reordered; "Build scenes from text" turns the seven product-profile text fields into a
starting set of scenes. Per scene, narration is resolved as: uploaded clip → browser
text-to-speech (if enabled) → silent timer. **Preview walkthrough** plays the unsaved draft.

## Study design material

`study_design/` holds the field-ready questionnaire (`BEACON_survey_questionnaire.md`
/ `.docx`), `conjoint_design.py` (regenerates `data/design/`), a sample Excel export, and
a detailed README on the instrument, screener logic and export format.
